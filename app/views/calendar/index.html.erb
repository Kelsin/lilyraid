<div class="raid">
  <h3>Calendar</h3>

  <p>This site provides some urls to use to plug into any calendar program that
    uses the ical (*.ics) format. This includes Google Calendar, Apple's iCal,
    Evolution (Linux), Mozilla Sunbird and others.</p>

  <h4><a href="/calendar/raids">Main Raid Calendar</a></h4>

  <p>This provides a main calendar which shows all raids that are scheduled by
    the site.</p>

  <h4><a href="/calendar/account/<%= @current_account.id %>">Per Account Calendar</a></h4>

  <p>You can also access a calendar which only displays the calendar for a
    certain account. This allows you to see only the raids that your account is
    signed up for. Notice that these are public (since all signups are public)
    so if you want the calendar for a different account you just have to replace
    the number at the end with the account id that you would like. This is the
    same number that's at the top of the main account pages which you can find
    using the member list.</p>

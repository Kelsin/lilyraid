<h2>Calendar</h2>

<p>This site provides some urls to use to plug into any calendar program that
  uses the ical (*.ics) format. This includes Google Calendar, Apple's iCal,
  Evolution (Linux), Mozilla Sunbird and others.</p>

<p>The main url to use in your calendar program
is: <a href="http://raids.dota-guild.com/calendar/raids">http://raids.dota-guild.com/calendar/raids</a>. This
provides a main calendar which shows all raids that are scheduled by the site.</p>

<p>You can also access a calendar which only displays the calendar for a certain
account. This allows you to see only the raids that your account is signed up
for. A link to this
calendar <a href="http://raids.dota-guild.com/calendar/account/<%= @current_account.id
%>">here</a>. Notice that these are public (since all signups are public) so if
you want the calendar for a different account you just have to replace the
number at the end with the account id that you would like. This is the same
number that's at the top of the main account pages which you can find using the
member list.</p>
